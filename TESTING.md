## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

When I validated the first full version of the website I got the following warning messages for all my html files. This is because the affected code was inside my base.html file, which cannot be validated seperately, but is part of all sites on the deployed website.

![initial-error-base-html](docs/testing/validation_html/base-html-initial-error.png)

I documented how I solved the warning messages in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive/issues/24). 
There I also tracked all remaining errors/warning messages. The links to the respective issue on GitHub can be found in the following table under "Initial result", if applicable.

The HTML files *"_event_card.html"* and *"_page_navigation.html"* were not seperately tested because they are called within the index, events-list and profile pages. I made sure to have enough events available in my dataset to trigger the pagination buttons, so that they would be present in the validated HTML code.

The final version of the website shows no further HTML Validation issues.

| Directory | File | URL | Final result | Initial result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| events/templates/events | [event_detail.html](https://github.com/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive/blob/main/events/templates/events/event_detail.html) |   | No Errors ![screenshot](docs/testing/validation_html/event-detail-html.png) | [Issue Link](https://github.com/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive/issues/26) ![screenshot](docs/testing/validation_html/event-detail-html-initial-error.png)  |
| events/templates/events | [event_form.html](https://github.com/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive/blob/main/events/templates/events/event_form.html) |   | Some HTML validation errors appear due to the way Summernote dynamically renders its editor (e.g., duplicate attributes, inline styles, or obsolete iframe attributes). These elements are generated by the library, not custom code, and do not affect functionality or accessibility. Since modifying Summernote’s internal HTML could break its behavior or updates, these minor validation warnings are acceptable to leave unresolved. ![screenshot](docs/testing/validation_html/event-form-html.png) | - |

All other html files under *runnershive/templates/account* were created using `allauth` and have not been altered by me.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| static | [style.css](https://github.com/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive/blob/main/static/css/style.css) | [W3C Link](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https://runners-hive-6fdb552cead0.herokuapp.com) | ![screenshot](docs/testing/validation_css/css-validation.png) | No Errors |

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files. Files that are unchanged from the Django template have been excluded from the validation as they are known to be valid.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |

## Responsiveness

I've tested my deployed project for responsiveness across screen sizes and found no issues.

I've only documented the 404 error page, as the other error pages use the same layout and only differ in the displayed text, so the test results are the same.

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility and found no issues. The results for the Safari browser were created using [Lambdatest](https://www.lambdatest.com/). Chrome and Edge are both installed on my own device.

I've only documented the 404 error page, as the other error pages use the same layout and only differ in the displayed text, so the test results are the same.

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.

I've only documented the 404 error page, as the other error pages use the same layout and only differ in the displayed text, so the test results are the same.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

> [!NOTE]  
> I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality. 

I created unit tests for the events app views which cover the applications main functionalities. All tests passed successfully:

![Test Results Screenshot](docs/testing/unit_tests_py/test-results.png)

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

- `python3 manage.py test events`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

- `pip3 install coverage`
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- `coverage run --omit="*/site-packages/*,*/migrations/*,*/__init__.py,env.py,.env" manage.py test`
- `coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

- `coverage html`
- `python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the full coverage report on my application that I've tested:

![screenshot](docs/testing/unit_tests_py/html-coverage.png)

#### Unit Test Issues

While writing the unit tests I realized that I was only redirecting to the 404 page when trying to edit, cancel or delete other users events or when trying to edit or cancel past events. To provide better feedback to the user I changed this to redirect to the profile page and show an info or error toast message instead, telling the user what went wrong.

## Bugs

### Fixed Bugs

[![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive?query=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20label%3Abug&label=Fixed%20Bugs&color=green)](https://www.github.com/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug)

I've used [GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive/issues) to track and manage major bugs and issues during the development and testing stages of my project.

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug).

![screenshot](docs/bugs/gh-issues-closed-bugs.png)

### Unfixed Bugs

To this date, no known unfixed errors remain in the application, though, even after thorough testing, I cannot rule out the possibility.

### Known Issues

| Issue | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| The project is designed to be responsive from `320px` and upwards, in line with the material taught on the course LMS. Minor layout inconsistencies may occur on extra-wide (e.g. 4k/8k monitors), or smart-display devices (e.g. Nest Hub, Smart Watches, Gameboy Color, etc.), as these resolutions are outside the project’s scope, as taught by Code Institute. | ![screenshot](docs/bugs/know-issues-overflow.png) |
| When validating the create event form, Some HTML validation errors appear due to the way Summernote dynamically renders its editor (e.g., duplicate attributes, inline styles, or obsolete iframe attributes). These elements are generated by the library, not custom code, and do not affect functionality or accessibility. Since modifying Summernote’s internal HTML could break its behavior or updates, these minor validation warnings are acceptable to leave unresolved.| ![screenshot](docs/testing/validation_html/event-form-html.png)|

> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, though, even after thorough testing, I cannot rule out the possibility.
