## Code Validation

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use the space below to discuss code validation for all of your own code files (*where applicable*). You are not required to validate external libraries/frameworks.

**MANDATORY**: You must provide a screenshot for each file you validate.

**PRO TIP**: Where possible, always validate the live URL pages/files, not your local code using copy/paste. There could be subtle/hidden differences.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

### HTML

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. [*recommended*] If you are using the live deployed site URLs, validate using this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri
2. Otherwise, if you are copying/pasting your HTML code manually, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input

It's recommended to validate the live pages (all of them) using the deployed URL. This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use below on your testing documentation. It makes it easier to return back to a page for validating it again in the future. The URL will look something like this:

- https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https://kathrinmzl.github.io/RunnersHive/index.html

üõë IMPORTANT üõë

RE: Python/Jinja syntax in HTML

Python projects that use Jinja syntax, such as `{% for loops %}`, `{% url 'home' %}`, and `{{ variable|filter }}` will not validate properly if you're copying/pasting into the HTML validator.

In order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to [validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Unfortunately, pages that require a user to be "logged-in" and authenticated (CRUD functionality) will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have access to login to an account on your project. In order to properly validate HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication.
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `‚åò+U` on Mac).
- This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
- Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated (e.g.: CRUD functionality).

üõë ---- END --- üõë

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

When I validated the first full version of the website I got the following warning messages for all my html files. This is because the affected code was inside my base.html file, which cannot be validated seperately, but is part of all sites on the deployed website.

![initial-error-base-html](docs/testing/validation_html/base-html-initial-error.png)

I documented how I solved the warning messages in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive/issues/24). 
There I also tracked all remaining errors/warning messages. The links to the respective issue on GitHub can be found in the following table under "Initial result", if applicable.

The HTML files *"_event_card.html"* and *"_page_navigation.html"* were not seperately tested because they are called within the index, events-list and profile pages. I made sure to have enough events available in my dataset to trigger the pagination buttons, so that they would be present in the validated HTML code.

The final version of the website shows no further HTML Validation issues.

## Responsiveness

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is to test the following 3 sizes:

- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of your results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the [amiresponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is) mockup images (*or similar*) does not meet the requirements. Consider using some of the built-in device sizes from the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well. It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

I've tested my deployed project to check for responsiveness issues.

## Browser Compatibility

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers. Consider testing at least 3 different browsers, if available on your system. You DO NOT need to use all of the browsers below, just pick any 3 (minimum).

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the browsers you've tested, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time. Some of these are paid services, but some are free. If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

## Defensive Programming

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important! When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each form field. Examples of this could include (but not limited to):

All Projects:

- Users cannot submit an empty form (add the `required` attribute)
- Users must enter valid field types (ensure the correct input `type=""` is used)
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted pages

Python Projects:

- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality if not authenticated (if login functionality exists)
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers/admins

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form, or CRUD functionality, for data manipulation on a database. Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser). You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable (can someone else replicate the same outcome?). Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website. Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine, consider documenting tests on each element of the page (eg. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their "happy flow", their "bad/exception flow", mentioning the expected and observed results, and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

- Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

## Bugs

### Fixed Bugs

[![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive?query=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20label%3Abug&label=Fixed%20Bugs&color=green)](https://www.github.com/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug)

I've used [GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive/issues) to track and manage bugs and issues during the development stages of my project.

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/kathrinmzl/RunnersHive/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug).

### Unfixed Bugs

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

You will need to mention any unfixed bugs and why they are not fixed upon submission of your project. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. Where possible, you must fix all outstanding bugs, unless outside of your control.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here! It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue, they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

### Known Issues
